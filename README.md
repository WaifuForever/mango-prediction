Still need to figure out how to build the best Keras model for this specific database.

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification

Inside Data Folder there is a Result folder with 2 subfolders named Good and Rotten, and a Augmented folder. 

To run Tensorflow, you need at least 3 GB of free RAM or a GPU

do not use vgg16 with adam optimizer!
do not put a Relu activaton fuction after a sigmoid in cnn architeture
Train_Generator no longer saves generated images into augmented folder, this part of the code is commented
